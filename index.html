<p><strong>Char Kuey Teow</strong><em> is basically flat rice noodles stir-fried with shrimp, bloody cockles, Chinese lap cheong (sausage), eggs, bean sprouts, and chives in a mix of soy sauce.</em></p>
<ul>
    <li>fresh and crunchy bean sprouts</li>
    <li>freshly-made noodles</li>
    <li>big, fat, succulent shrimp/prawn, </li>
    <li>bloody cockles</li>
    <li>four large eggs</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <Li>Grind all the ingredients of the chili paste using a mini food processor until fine. Heat up a wok with 1 teaspoon oil and stir-fry the chili paste until aromatic. Dish out and set aside.</Li>
    <li>Clean the wok thoroughly and heat it over high flame until it starts to smoke. Add 2 tablespoons oil/lard into the wok and add half the portion of chopped garlic into the wok and do a quick stir.</li>
    <Li>Transfer six (6) prawn out of water and half the sausage slices into the wok. Make a few quick stirs with the spatula until the prawn starts to change color and you smell the aroma of the Chinese sausage.</Li>
    <li>Add half the bean sprouts into the wok.</li>
    <Li>Immediately follow by 8 oz. or half portion of the flat noodles.</Li>
    <li>Add 2 1/2 tablespoons of the sauce into the wok and stir vigorously to blend well. Using the spatula, push the noodles to one side, and add a little oil on the empty area and crack an egg on it. Use the spatula to break the egg yolk and stir to blend with the egg white. Flip the noodles and cover the egg, and wait for about 15 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add about 1/2 tablespoon of chili paste (if you like it spicy, add more) and some cockle clams into the wok.</li>
    <Li>Continue to stir-fry and make sure the egg is cooked through. Add chives, do a couple of quick stirs, dish out and serve immediately.</Li>
